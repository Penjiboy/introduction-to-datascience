## Introduction to Data Science
This is the source for the Introduction to Data Science textbook.

## Setup and Build

1. Install Docker (instructions here: [https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/))

2. Run RStudio inside the `intro-to-ds` docker container:
    - in terminal, navigate to the root of this project repo
    - type the following in terminal:
    ```
    docker run --rm -it -p 8787:8787 -v $PWD:/home/rstudio -e PASSWORD=password intro-to-ds
    ```
    - Open a web browser and type [http://localhost:8787/](http://localhost:8787/)
    
3. Finally, you can render the book with the following R code:
    ```
    bookdown::render_book('index.Rmd', 'bookdown::gitbook')
    ```

## Style Guide

- For R code block labels, use the format `##-[name with only alphanumeric + hyphens]` where the `##` is the 2-digit chapter number, e.g. `03-test-name` for a label `test-name` in chapter 3

## Repository Organization / Important Files
- The files `index.Rmd` and `##-name.Rmd` are [R-markdown](https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/) chapter contents to be parsed by [Bookdown](https://bookdown.org/)
- `_bookdown.yml` sets the output directory (`docs/`) and default chapter name
- `img/` contains custom images to be used in the text; note this is not all of the images as some are generated by R code when compiling
- `data/` stores datasets processed during compile
- `docs/.nojekyll` tells github's static site builder not to run [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/). This avoids Jekyll deleting the folder `docs/_main_files` (as it starts with an underscore)
