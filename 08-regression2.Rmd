# Regression, continued {#regression2}

## Overview 
Continued explortion of k-nn regression in higher dimensions. We will also begin to compare k-nn to linear models in the context of regression.

## Learning objectives 
By the end of the chapter, students will be able to:

* In the context of k-nn regression, compare and contrast goodness of fit and prediction properties (namely MSE vs MSPE).
* In a dataset with 2 variables, perform simple ordinary least squares regression in R using `lm()` to predict the values for a test dataset.
* Compare and contrast predictions obtained from k-nearest neighbour regression to those obtained using simple ordinary least squares regression from the same dataset.
