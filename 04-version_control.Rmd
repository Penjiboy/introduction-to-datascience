## Overview 
We will be using version control with GitHub and Git to share our code on group projects. Here is a list of videos you might want to watch to familiarize yourself further with these tools, as well as a cheatsheet of Git and terminal commands.

## Git command cheatsheet

Because we are writing code on a server, we need to use Git in the terminal to get files from GitHub, and to send back changes to the files that we make on the server. Below is a cheat sheet of the commands you will need and what they are for:

### Getting a repository from GitHub onto the server for the first time
*This is done only once for a repository when you want to copy it to a new computer.*
```
git clone https://github.com/USERNAME/GITHUB_REPOSITORY_NAME.git
```

### Logging changes
After editing and saving your files (e.g., a Jupyter notebook):
```
git add FILENAME
git commit -m "some message about the changes you made"
```

### Sending your changes back to GitHub
After logging your changes (as shown above):
```
git push
```

### Getting changes
To get the changes your collaborator just sent to GitHub onto your server:
```
git pull
```

## Terminal cheatsheet

We need to run the above Git commands from inside the repository/folder that we cloned from GitHub. To navigate there in the terminal, you will need to use the following commands:

### See where you are:
```
pwd
```

### See what is inside the directory where you are:
```
ls
```

### Move to a different directory
```
cd DIRECTORY_PATH
```
