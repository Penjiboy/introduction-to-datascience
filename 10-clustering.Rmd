# Clustering {#clustering}

## Overview 
Introduction to clustering using K-means. Will discuss the K-means algorithm, how we choose K (the number of clusters) and other practical considerations (such as scaling).

## Learning objectives 
By the end of the chapter, students will be able to:

* Describe a case where clustering would be an appropriate tool, and what insight it would bring from the data.
* Explain the kmeans clustering algorithm.
* Interpret the output of a kmeans cluster analysis.
* Perform kmeans clustering in R using `kmeans`.
* Visualize the output of kmeans clustering in R using pair-wise scatter plots.
* Identify when it is necessary to scale variables before clustering and do this using R.
* Use the elbow method to choose the number of clusters for k-means.
* Describe advantages, limitations and assumptions of the kmeans clustering algorithm.
