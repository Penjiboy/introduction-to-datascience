# Classification I: Training & predicting {#classification}

## Overview 
Up until this point, we have focused solely on descriptive and exploratory questions about data. This chapter and the next together serve as our 
first foray into answering *predictive* questions about data. In particular, we will focus on the problem of *classification*, i.e.,
using one or more quantitative variables to predict the value of a third, categorical variable. This chapter will cover the basics of classification,
how to preprocess data to make it suitable for use in a classifier,
and how to use our observed data to make predictions. The next will focus on how to evaluate how accurate the predictions from our classifier are, as well as how to 
improve our classifier (where possible) to maximize its accuracy.

## Chapter learning objectives 
- Recognize situations where a classifier would be appropriate for making predictions
- Describe what a training data set is and how it is used in classification
- Interpret the output of a classifier
- Compute, by hand, the straight-line (Euclidean) distance between points on a graph when there are two explanatory variables/predictors
- Explain the K-nearest neighbour classification algorithm
- Standardize variables in R, and explain why standardization is useful in predictive modelling
- Handle imbalanced data by oversampling in R, and explain why imbalanced data are problematic for classifiers
- Perform K-nearest neighbour classification in R using `caret::train(method = "knn", ...)`

## The classification problem
In many situations, we want to make predictions based on the current situation as well as past experiences. For instance, a doctor may want to diagnose 
a patient as either diseased or healthy based on their symptoms and the doctor's past experience with patients; an email provider might want to tag a given email as "spam" or "non-spam"
depending on past email text data; or an online store may want to predict whether an order is fraudulent or not. 

These tasks are all examples of **classification**, i.e., predicting a categorical class (sometimes called a *label*) for an observation given its other
quantitative variables (sometimes called *features*). Generally, a classifier assigns an observation (e.g. a new patient) to a class (e.g. diseased or healthy) on 
the basis of how similar it is to other observations for which we know the class (e.g. previous patients with known diseases and symptoms). These observations 
with known classes that we use as a basis for prediction are called a **training set**. We call them a "training set" because we use these observations to train, or 
teach, our classifier so that we can use it to make predictions on new data that we have not seen previously.

There are many possible classification algorithms that we could use to predict a categorical class/label for an observation. In addition, there are many
variations on the basic classification problem, e.g.,  binary classification where only two classes are involved (e.g. disease or healthy patient), or multiclass classification, which involves 
assigning an object to one of several classes (e.g., private, public, or not for-profit organization). Here we will focus on the simple, widely used **K-nearest neighbours**
algorithm for the binary classification problem. Other examples you may encounter in future courses include decision trees, support vector machines (SVMs), logistic regression, and neural
networks.

## Exploring a labelled data set

In this chapter and the next, we will study a data set of [digitized breast cancer image features](http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Breast+Cancer+Wisconsin+%28Diagnostic%29), 
created by Dr. William H. Wolberg, W. Nick Street, and Olvi L. Mangasarian at the University of Wisconsin, Madison. Each row in the data set represents an image of a tumour sample, 
including the diagnosis (benign or malignant) and several other measurements 
(e.g., nucleus texture, perimeter, area, etc.). Diagnosis for each image was conducted by physicians. 

As with all data analyses, we first need to formulate a precise question that we want to answer. Here, the question is *predictive*: can 
we use the tumour image measurements available to us to predict whether a future tumour image (with unknown diagnosis)
shows a benign or malignant tumour? Answering this question is important because traditional, non-data-driven methods for tumour diagnosis are quite subjective and 
dependent upon how skilled and experienced the diagnosing physician is. Furthermore, benign tumours are not normally dangerous; the cells stay in the same 
place and the tumour stops growing before it gets very large. By contrast, in malignant tumours, the cells invade the surrounding tissue and spread into nearby organs 
where they can cause serious damage ([learn more about cancer here](https://www.worldwidecancerresearch.org/who-we-are/cancer-basics/)). Thus, it is important to quickly 
and accurately diagnose the tumour type to guide patient treatment.

**Loading the data**

Our first step is to load, wrangle, and explore the data using visualizations in order to better understand the data we are working with.
We start by loading the necessary libraries for our analysis. Below you'll see (in addition to the usual `tidyverse`) a new library, `forcats`, that 
enables us to easily manipulate factors in R. Factors are a special categorical type of variable in R that are very helpful when doing data analysis with categorical variables.

```{r 05-load-libraries}
library(tidyverse)
library(forcats)
```

In this case, the file containing the breast cancer data set is a simple `.csv` file with headers. We'll use the `read_csv` function with no additional arguments,
and then the `head` function to inspect its contents:

```{r 05-read-data}
cancer <- read_csv("data/clean-wdbc.data.csv")
head(cancer)
```

**Variable descriptions**

Breast tumours can be diagnosed by performing a *biopsy*, a process where tissue is removed from the body to diagnose the presence of a disease. Traditionally these procedures 
were quite invasive; modern methods such as fine needle asipiration, used to collect the present data set, extract only a small amount of tissue and are less invasive. Based
on a digital image of each breast tissue sample collected for this data set, 10 different variables were measured for each cell nucleus in the image (3-12 below), and then
the mean of the three largest values for each variable across the nuclei was recorded. As part of the data preparation, these values have been *scaled*; we will discuss what this means 
and why we do it later in this chapter. Each image additionally was given a unique ID and a diagnosis for malignance by a physician.
 Therefore, the total set of variables per image in this data set are:


1. ID number 
2. Class - diagnosis (M = malignant, B = benign) 
3. radius (mean of distances from center to points on the perimeter) 
4. texture (standard deviation of gray-scale values) 
5. perimeter 
6. area 
7. smoothness (local variation in radius lengths) 
8. compactness ($perimeter^2 / area - 1.0$) 
9. concavity (severity of concave portions of the contour) 
10. concave points (number of concave portions of the contour) 
11. symmetry 
12. fractal dimension ($"coastline\: approximation" - 1$)

Below we use `glimpse` to preview the data frame. This function is similar to `head`, but can be easier to read when we have a lot of columns:

```{r 05-glimpse}
glimpse(cancer)
```

We can see from the summary of the data above that `Class` is of type character (denoted by `<chr>`). Since we are going to be working with `Class` as a categorical statistical 
variable, we will convert it to factor using the function `as.factor`.

```{r 05-class, echo = TRUE}
cancer <- cancer %>% 
  mutate(Class = as.factor(Class)) 
```

Factors have what are called "levels", which you can think of as categories. We can ask for the levels from the `Class` column by using the `levels` function. This function should return 
the name of each category in that column. Given that we only have 2 different values in our `Class` column ("B" and "M"), we only expect to get two names back. If we had 4 different values 
in the column, we would expect to get 4 back. *Note the use of `unlist` to between `select` and `levels`. This is because `select` outputs a data frame (even though we only select a single column), and levels expects a vector.*

```{r 05-levels, echo = TRUE}
cancer %>% 
  select(Class) %>% 
  unlist() %>% # turns a data frame into a vector
  levels()
```

**Exploring the data**

Before we start doing any modelling, let's explore our data set. Below we use the `group_by` + `summarize` code pattern we used before to see that we have 357 (63\%) benign and 212 (37\%) malignant tumour observations.

```{r 05-tally}
num_obs <- nrow(cancer)
cancer %>% 
  group_by(Class) %>% 
  summarize(n = n(),
            percentage = n() / num_obs * 100)
```

Next, let's draw a scatter plot to visualize the relationship between the perimeter and concavity variables. Rather than use `ggplot's` default palette, we define our own here (`cbPalette`) and pass it 
as the `values` argument to the `scale_color_manual` function. We also make the category labels ("B" and "M") more readable by changing them to "Benign" and "Malignant" using the `labels` argument.

```{r 05-scatter, fig.height = 4, fig.width = 5}
# colour palette
cbPalette <- c("#56B4E9", "#E69F00","#009E73", "#F0E442", "#0072B2", "#D55E00", "#CC79A7", "#999999") 

perim_concav <- cancer %>%  
  ggplot(aes(x = Perimeter, y = Concavity, color = Class)) + 
    geom_point(alpha = 0.5) +
    labs(color = "Diagnosis") + 
    scale_color_manual(labels = c("Benign", "Malignant"), values = cbPalette)
perim_concav
```

In this visualization, we can see that benign observations typically fall in the the lower left-hand side of the plot area. By contrast, malignant observations typically fall in upper right-hand side of 
the plot. Suppose we obtain a new observation not in the current data set that has all the variables measured *except* the label (i.e., an image without the physician's diagnosis for the tumour class). We
could compute the perimeter and concavity values, resulting in values of, say, 1 and 1. Could we use this information to classify that observation as benign or malignant? What about a new 
observation with perimeter value of -1 and concavity value of -0.5? What about 0 and 1? It seems like the *prediction of an unobserved label* might be possible, based on our visualization. 
In order to actually do this computationally in practice, we will need a classification algorithm; here we will use the K-nearest neighbour classification algorithm.

## Classification with K-nearest neighbours

```{r 05-knn-0, echo = FALSE}
## Find the distance between new point and all others in data set
euclidDist <- function(point1, point2) {
    #Returns the Euclidean distance between point1 and point2.
    #Each argument is an array containing the coordinates of a point."""
    (sqrt(sum((point1 - point2)^2)))}
distance_from_point <- function(row) {
           euclidDist(new_point, row) }
all_distances <- function(training, new_point){
    #Returns an array of distances
    #between each point in the training set
   # and the new point (which is a row of attributes)
    distance_from_point <- function(row) {
           euclidDist(new_point, row)
}
      apply(training, MARGIN = 1, distance_from_point)
}
table_with_distances <- function(training, new_point){
    #Augments the training table 
    # with a column of distances from new_point
    data.frame(training, Distance = all_distances(training, new_point))
}
new_point <- c(2, 4)
attrs <- c("Perimeter", "Concavity")
my_distances <- table_with_distances(cancer[,attrs], new_point)
neighbours <- cancer[order(my_distances$Distance),]
```
To predict the label of a new observation, i.e., classify it as either benign or malignant, the K-nearest neighbour classifier generally finds the $K$ "nearest" or "most similar" 
observations in our training set, and then uses their diagnoses to make a prediction for the new observation's diagnosis. To illustrate this concept, we will walk through an example.
Suppose we have a new observation, with perimeter of `r new_point[1]` and concavity of `r new_point[2]` (labelled in red on the scatterplot), whose diagnosis "Class" is unknown.

<center>
```{r 05-knn-1, echo = FALSE, fig.height = 4, fig.width = 5}
perim_concav + 
  geom_point(aes(x=new_point[1], y=new_point[2]), color=cbPalette[6], size = 2.5) 
```
</center>

We see that the nearest point to this new observation is **malignant** and located at the coordinates (`r round(neighbours[1, c(attrs[1], attrs[2])], 1)`). The idea here is that if 
a point is close to another in the scatterplot, then the perimeter and concavity values are similar, and so we may expect that they would have the same diagnosis. 

<center>
```{r 05-knn-2, echo = FALSE, fig.height = 4, fig.width = 5}
perim_concav + geom_point(aes(x=new_point[1], y=new_point[2]), 
               color=cbPalette[6], 
               size = 2.5) +
  geom_segment(aes(x = new_point[1], 
                   y = new_point[2], 
                   xend = unlist(neighbours[1, attrs[1]]), 
                   yend = unlist(neighbours[1, attrs[2]])), color = "black")
```
</center>

```{r 05-knn-3, echo = FALSE}
new_point <- c(0.38, 1.8)
attrs <- c("Perimeter", "Concavity")
my_distances <- table_with_distances(cancer[,attrs], new_point)
neighbours <- cancer[order(my_distances$Distance),]
```

Suppose we have another new observation with perimeter `r new_point[1]` and concavity of `r new_point[2]`. Looking at the scatterplot below, how would you classify this red observation? The 
nearest neighbour to this new point is a **benign** observation at (`r round(neighbours[1, c(attrs[1], attrs[2])], 1)`). Does this seem like the right prediction to make? Probably not, 
if you consider the other nearby points...

<center>
```{r 05-knn-4, echo = FALSE, fig.height = 4, fig.width = 5}
perim_concav + geom_point(aes(x=new_point[1], y=new_point[2]), 
               color=cbPalette[6], 
               size = 2.5) +  
  geom_segment(aes(x = new_point[1], 
                   y = new_point[2], 
                   xend = unlist(neighbours[1, attrs[1]]), 
                   yend = unlist(neighbours[1, attrs[2]])), color = "black")
```
</center>

So instead of just using the one nearest neighbour, we can consider several neighbouring points, say $K = 3$, that are closest to the new red observation to predict its diagnosis class. Among those 3 closest 
points, we use the *majority class* as our prediction for the new observation. In this case, we see that the diagnoses of 2 of the 3 nearest neighbours to our new 
observation are malignant. Therefore we take majority vote and classify our new red observation as malignant. 
<!-- For our red observation at (`r new_point`), the nearest points are: (`r round(neighbours[1, c(attrs[1], attrs[2])], 1)`), (`r round(neighbours[2,  c(attrs[1], attrs[2])],1)`), and (`r round(neighbours[3, c(attrs[1], attrs[2])],1)`). -->

<center>
```{r 05-knn-5, echo =  FALSE, fig.height = 4, fig.width = 5}
perim_concav + geom_point(aes(x=new_point[1], y=new_point[2]), 
               color=cbPalette[6], 
               size = 2.5) +
  geom_segment(aes(x = new_point[1], y = new_point[2],
                   xend = unlist(neighbours[1, attrs[1]]),
                   yend = unlist(neighbours[1, attrs[2]])), color = "black") +
    geom_segment(aes(x = new_point[1], y = new_point[2],
                   xend = unlist(neighbours[2, attrs[1]]),
                   yend = unlist(neighbours[2, attrs[2]])), color = "black")+
      geom_segment(aes(x = new_point[1], y = new_point[2],
                   xend = unlist(neighbours[3, attrs[1]]),
                   yend = unlist(neighbours[3, attrs[2]])), color = "black")
```
</center>



```{r 05-knn-6, echo = FALSE}
#neighbours %>% 
#  select(ID, attrs, Class) %>% 
#  slice(1:3)
```

Here we chose the $K=3$ nearest observations, but there is nothing special about $K=3$. We could have used $K=4, 5$ or more (though we may want to choose an odd number 
to avoid ties). We will discuss more about choosing $K$ in the next chapter. 

**Distance between points** 

How do we decide which points are the $K$ "nearest" to our new observation? We can compute the distance between any pair of points using the following formula: 

$$\mathrm{Distance} = \sqrt{(x_a -x_b)^2 + (y_a - y_b)^2}$$
```{r 05-multiknn-0, echo = FALSE}
new_point <- c(-1,4.2)
```

> This formula -- sometimes called the *Euclidean distance* -- is simply the straight line distance between two points on the x-y plane with coordinates $(x_a, y_a)$ and $(x_b, y_b)$.

Suppose we want to classify a new observation with perimeter of `r new_point[1]` and concavity of `r new_point[2]`. Let's calculate the distances between our 
new point and each of the observations in the training set to find the $K=5$ observations in the training data that are nearest to our new point. 

<center>
```{r 05-multiknn-1, echo = FALSE, fig.height = 4, fig.width = 5}
perim_concav <- cancer %>%    
  ggplot(aes(x=Perimeter, y=Concavity, color = Class)) + 
    geom_point() +
    scale_x_continuous(name = "Perimeter", breaks=seq(-2,4,1)) +
    scale_y_continuous(name = "Concavity", breaks=seq(-2,4,1)) +
    labs(color = "Diagnosis") + 
    scale_color_manual(labels = c("Benign", "Malignant"), values = cbPalette) +
    geom_point(aes(x=new_point[1], y=new_point[2]), color=cbPalette[6], size = 2.5) 
perim_concav
```
</center>


```{r 05-multiknn-2}
new_obs_Perimeter <- -1
new_obs_Concavity <- 4.2
cancer %>% select(ID, Perimeter, Concavity, Class) %>% 
  mutate(dist_from_new = sqrt((Perimeter - new_obs_Perimeter)^2  + (Concavity - new_obs_Concavity)^2)) %>% 
  arrange(dist_from_new) %>% 
  head(n = 5)
```

From this, we see that 3 of the 5 nearest neighbours to our new observation are malignant so classify our new observation as malignant. We circle those 5 in the plot below:

<center>
```{r 05-multiknn-3, echo = FALSE}
perim_concav + annotate("path", 
                        x=new_point[1] + 1.7 * cos(seq(0,2 * pi, 
                                                       length.out = 100)),
                        y=new_point[2] + 1.7 * sin(seq(0,2 * pi, 
                                                       length.out = 100)))
```
</center>

```{r 05-multiknn-4, echo = FALSE}
my_distances <- table_with_distances(cancer[,attrs], new_point)
neighbours <- my_distances[order(my_distances$Distance),]
k <- 5
tab <- data.frame(neighbours[1:k,], cancer[order(my_distances$Distance),][1:k,c("ID","Class")])
```

It can be difficult sometimes to read code as math, so here we mathematically show the calculation of distance for each of the 5 closest points.

|Perimeter | Concavity | Distance          | Class          |
 |----------------- | -----------------    | ---------------| ----------------- |
| `r round(tab[1,1],2) `              	| `r round(tab[1,2],2) `             |$\sqrt{-1  - (-1.24))^2 + (4.2 - 4.7)^2}=$ `r round(neighbours[1, "Distance"],2)` |	`r tab[1, "Class"]`  | 
|`r round(tab[2,1],2) `              |`r round(tab[2,2],2) `               |$\sqrt{(-1 - (-0.29))^2 + (4.2 - 3.99)^2} =$ `r round(neighbours[2, "Distance"],2)`	|`r tab[2, "Class"]`  |
|`r round(tab[3,1],2) `              |`r round(tab[3,2],2) `        | $\sqrt{(-1 - (-1.08))^2 + (4.2 - 2.63)^2} =$ `r round(neighbours[3, "Distance"],2)` | `r tab[3, "Class"]`|
|`r round(tab[4,1],2) `              |`r round(tab[4,2],2) `        | $\sqrt{(-1 - (-0.46))^2 + (4.2 - 2.72)^2} =$ `r round(neighbours[4, "Distance"],2)` | `r tab[4, "Class"]`|
|`r round(tab[5,1],2) `              |`r round(tab[5,2],2) `        | $\sqrt{(-1 - 0.64)^2 + (4.2 - 4.3)^2} =$ `r round(neighbours[5, "Distance"],2)` | `r tab[5, "Class"]`|
-----------------     ----------------- ----------------- 


**More than two explanatory variables**

Although the above description is directed toward two explanatory variables / predictors, exactly the same K-nearest neighbour algorithm applies 
when you have a higher number of explanatory variables (i.e., a higher-dimensional predictor space). 
Each explanatory variable/predictor can give us new information to help create our classifier.
The only difference is the formula for the distance between points. In particular, let's say we have $m$ predictor variables for two observations $u$ and $v$,
i.e., 
$u = (u_{1}, u_{2}, \dots, u_{m})$ and
$v = (v_{1}, v_{2}, \dots, v_{m})$.
Before, we added up the squared difference between each of our (two) variables, and then took the square root; now we will do the same, except for *all* of our $m$ variables.
In other words, the distance formula becomes

$$Distance = \sqrt{(u_{1} -v_{1})^2 + (u_{2} - v_{2})^2 + \dots + (u_{m} - v_{m})^2}$$

**Summary**

In order to classify a new observation using a K-nearest neighbour classifier, we have to:

1. Compute the distance between the new observation and each observation in the training set
2. Sort the data table in ascending order according to the distances
3. Choose the top $K$ rows of the sorted table
4. Classify the new observation based on a majority vote of the neighbour classes


## K-nearest neighbours in R

Coding the K-nearest neighbour algorithm in R ourselves would get complicated if we might have to predict the label/class for multiple new observations, or when there 
are multiple classes and more than two variables. Thankfully, in R, the K-nearest neighbour algorithm is implemented in 
the [`caret` package](https://topepo.github.io/caret/index.html) (**c**lassification **a**nd **re**gression **t**raining). The `caret` library 
contains a set of tools to help make and use predictive models, such as classifiers. 
Using this package will help keep our code simple, readable and accurate; the less we have to code ourselves, the less mistakes we are likely to make.

We start off by loading the `caret` library:

```{r 05-caret}
library(caret)
```

Let's again suppose we have a new observation with perimeter -1 and concavity 4.2, but its diagnosis is unknown (as in our example above). Suppose we again want to use the 
perimeter and concavity explanatory variables/predictors to predict the diagnosis class of this observation. Let's pick out our 2 desired variables and store it as a 
new dataset named `cancer_train`:

```{r 05-caret-2}
cancer_train <- cancer %>%
  select("Perimeter", "Concavity")
head(cancer_train)
```

Next, we store the diagnosis class labels (column `Class`) as a vector:
```{r 05-caret-3}
cancer_labels <- cancer %>% 
  select(Class) %>% 
  unlist()
head(cancer_labels)
```

We will use the function `train()`, where:

- `x` is a data frame object containing the explanatory variables/predictors,
- `y` is a numeric or factor vector containing the outcomes/labels/classes,
- `method` is the type of prediction algorithm we want to use, we will use "knn", and
- `tuneGrid` is a data frame with possible "tuning values". For now, just know that this is where we will specify $K=5$ (the number of nearest neighbours to vote on the predicted class).

The arguments `x` and `y` should come from the original data frame and be in the same order. We will also discuss how to choose $K$ in the next chapter. 





```{r 05-train}
k <- data.frame(k = 5)
model_knn <- train(x = data.frame(cancer_train), y = cancer_labels, method='knn', tuneGrid = k)
```
> **Note:** the `caret` package expects `data.frames` and not `tibbles` (a special kind of data frames). This is a 
> bit annoying, and will likely change in the future, but for now we have to change `tibbles` to `data.frames` when using `caret`.

Now we can create a `data.frame` with our new observation and predict the label of the new observation using the `predict` function:

```{r 05-predict}
new_obs <- data.frame(Perimeter = -1, Concavity = 4.2)
predict(object = model_knn, new_obs)
```

Our model classifies this new observation as malignant. In the next chapter, we will discuss evaluating how accurate our predictions are, and selecting the value of $K$
to maximize that accuracy.




## Data preprocessing 

### Shifting and scaling

When using K-nearest neighbour classification, the *scale* of each variable (i.e., its size and range of values) matters. Since 
the classifier predicts classes by identifying observations that are nearest to it, any variables that have a large scale will have a 
much larger effect than variables with a small scale. But just because a variable has a large scale *doesn't mean* that it is more important
for making accurate predictions. For example, suppose you have a data set with two attributes, salary 
(in dollars) and years of education, and you want to predict the corresponding type of job. When we compute the neighbour distances, a difference 
of \$1000 is huge compared to a difference of 10 years of education. But for our conceptual understanding and answering of the problem, it's 
the opposite; 10 years of education is huge compared to a difference of \$1000 in yearly salary!

In many other predictive models, the *center* of each variable (e.g., its mean) matters as well. For example, if we had a data set
with a temperature variable measured in degrees Kelvin, and the same data set with temperature measured in degrees Celcius, the two variables
would differ by a constant shift of 273 (even though they contain exactly the same information). Likewise in our hypothetical job classification 
example, we would likely see that the center of the salary variable is in the tens of thousands, while the center of the years of education 
variable is in the single digits. Although this doesn't affect the K-nearest neighbour classification algorithm, this large shift can 
change the outcome of using many other predictive models. 

**Standardization:** when all variables in a data set have a mean (center) of 0 and a standard deviation (scale) of 1, we say that the data have been *standardized*.

To illustrate the effect that standardization can have on the K-nearest neighbour algorithm, we 
will read in the original, unscaled Wisconsin breast cancer data set; we have been using a standardized version of the data set up until now. In order
to do this we will download the raw data from the UCI Machine learning repository, and then compute the unscaled columns equivalent to those we have been working with 
in the scaled version of the data set ("worst" measures). 

```{r download unscaled data and clean up, warning = FALSE, echo =  FALSE}
unscaled_cancer <- read_csv("https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/machine-learning-databases/breast-cancer-wisconsin/wdbc.data", 
                            col_names = FALSE) %>% 
  select(X1, X2, X11:X20)
colnames(unscaled_cancer) <- colnames(cancer)
unscaled_cancer <- select(unscaled_cancer, -ID)
write_csv(unscaled_cancer, "data/unscaled-wdbc.data.csv")
```

```{r 06-scaling-1, message = FALSE}
unscaled_cancer <- read_csv("data/unscaled-wdbc.data.csv")
head(unscaled_cancer)
```

Looking at the unscaled / unshifted data above, you can see that the difference between the values for smoothness measurements are much larger than those for area, and the mean appears to be much larger too. Will this affect predictions? In order to find out, we will create a scatter plot of these two predictors (coloured by diagnosis) for both the unstandardized data we just loaded, and the standardized version of that same data. 

We will use the `preProcess` function from `caret` to create an object we can use to standardize the `unscaled_cancer` data set. When we do this, we need to specify the `method` argument to be `c("center", "scale")` so that the standardization results in the predictors having a mean (center) of 0 and a standard deviation (scale) of 1. Finally, we use the `predict` function to apply the data transformation to our data set:

```{r 06-scaling-3}
scale_transformer <- preProcess(unscaled_cancer, method = c("center", "scale")) 
scaled_cancer <- predict(scale_transformer, unscaled_cancer)
head(scaled_cancer)
```

Now let's generate the two scatter plots, one for `unscaled_cancer` and one for `scaled_cancer`, and show them side-by-side:

<center>
```{r 06-scaling-2, echo =  FALSE,  fig.height = 4, fig.width = 10}
unscaled_cancer$ID <- as.numeric(row.names(unscaled_cancer))
scaled_cancer$ID <- as.numeric(row.names(unscaled_cancer))

unscaled_cancer <- unscaled_cancer %>% 
  select(ID, Class, Area, Smoothness)
new_obs <- tibble(ID = 99999, Class = "unknown", Area = 3.7, Smoothness = 5.3)
unscaled_cancer <- bind_rows(unscaled_cancer, new_obs)

unscaled <- ggplot(unscaled_cancer, aes(x = Area, y = Smoothness, color = Class)) +
    geom_point(alpha = 0.6) +
    labs(color = "Diagnosis") + 
    scale_color_manual(labels = c("Benign", "Malignant"), values = c("#56B4E9", "#E69F00", "red")) +
    labs(color = "Diagnosis") + 
    ggtitle("Nonstandardized Data") +
    #geom_point(aes(x = 40.73, y = 0.1506), color = cbPalette[6], size = 2.5) + 
    coord_equal(ratio = 1) +
    xlim(c(-2, 6)) + # zooming into only data that falls between 0 and 86 on the x-axis
    ylim(c(-2, 6))

scaled_cancer <- unscaled_cancer %>% 
  select(-c(ID,Class)) %>% 
  scale(center = TRUE) 
scaled_cancer <- data.frame(ID = unscaled_cancer$ID, Class = unscaled_cancer$Class, scaled_cancer)

scaled <- ggplot(scaled_cancer, aes(x = Area, y = Smoothness, color = Class)) +
    geom_point(alpha = 0.6) +
    labs(color = "Diagnosis") + 
    scale_color_manual(labels = c("Benign", "Malignant"), values = c("#56B4E9", "#E69F00", "red")) +
    labs(color = "Diagnosis") + 
    ggtitle("Standardized Data") +
    coord_equal(ratio = 1) +
    #geom_point(aes(x = 0.008637332, y = -1.114815397), color = cbPalette[6], size = 2.5) #+
    #xlim(c(-2, 3.9)) # zooming into only data that falls between 0 and ~ 3.9 on the x-axis
    xlim(c(-2, 6)) + # zooming into only data that falls between 0 and 86 on the x-axis
    ylim(c(-2, 6))
    
gridExtra::grid.arrange(unscaled, scaled, ncol = 2)
```
</center>

In the plot with the original data above, its very clear that K-nearest neighbours would classify the 
red dot (new observation) as malignant. However, once we standardize the data, the diagnosis class labelling 
becomes less clear, and appears it would depend upon the choice of $K$. Thus, 
standardizing the data can change things in an important way when we are using predictive algorithms. 
As a rule of thumb, standardizing your data should be a part of the preprocessing you do before any predictive
modelling / analysis.

### Balancing

Another potential issue in a data set for a classifier is *class imbalance*, i.e., when one label is much more common
than another. Since classifiers like the K-nearest neighbour algorithm use the labels of nearby points to predict the
label of a new point, if there are many more data points with one label overall, the algorithm is more likely to pick
that label in general (even if the "pattern" of data suggests otherwise). Class imbalance is actually quite a common
and important problem: from rare disease diagnosis to malicious email detection, there are many cases in which the "important"
class to identify (presence of disease, malicious email) is much rarer than the "unimportant" 
class (no disease, normal email).

To better illustrate the problem, let's revisit the breast cancer data; except now we will remove many of the 
observations of malignant tumours, simulating what the data would look like if the cancer was rare. We will
do this by picking only 3 observations randomly from the malignant group, and keeping all of the benign observations.

```{r 05-unbalanced, fig.height = 4, fig.width = 5}
set.seed(1)
rare_cancer <- bind_rows(filter(cancer, Class == "B"),
		cancer %>%
		filter(Class == "M") %>%
		sample_n(3)
			)
rare_plot <- rare_cancer %>%  
  ggplot(aes(x = Perimeter, y = Concavity, color = Class)) + 
    geom_point(alpha = 0.5) +
    labs(color = "Diagnosis") + 
    scale_color_manual(labels = c("Benign", "Malignant"), values = cbPalette)
rare_plot
```

> Note: You will see in the code above that we use the `set.seed` function. This is because we are using `sample_n` to artificially pick
> only 3 of the malignant tumour observations, which uses random sampling to choose which rows will be in the training set. In order to
> make the code reproducible, we use `set.seed` to specify where the random number generator starts for this 
> process, which then guarantees the same result, i.e., the same choice of 3 observations, each time the code is run. In general, when your
> code involves random numbers, if you want *the same result* each time, you should use `set.seed`; if you want a *different result* each time,
> you should not.

Suppose we now decided to use $K = 7$ in K-nearest neighbour classification. With only 3 observations of malignant
tumours, the classifier will *always predict that the tumour is benign, no matter what its concavity and perimeter are!* This is because in a majority
vote of 7 observations, at most 3 will be malignant (we only have 3 total malignant observations), so at least 4 must be benign,
and the benign vote will always win. For example, look what happens for a new tumour observation that is quite close to two
that were tagged as malignant:

<center>
```{r 05-upsample, echo=FALSE, fig.height = 4, fig.width = 5}
new_point <- c(3, 2)
attrs <- c("Perimeter", "Concavity")
my_distances <- table_with_distances(rare_cancer[,attrs], new_point)
my_distances <- bind_cols(my_distances, select(rare_cancer, Class))
neighbours <- rare_cancer[order(my_distances$Distance),]

for (i in 1:7) {  
    clr = cbPalette[1]
    if (neighbours$Class[i] == "M"){
        clr = cbPalette[2]
    }
    rare_plot <- rare_plot + 
                 geom_segment(x = new_point[1], 
                   y = new_point[2], 
                   xend = unlist(neighbours[i, attrs[1]]), 
                   yend = unlist(neighbours[i, attrs[2]]), color = clr) 
}
rare_plot + geom_point(aes(x=new_point[1], y=new_point[2]), 
               color=cbPalette[6], 
               size = 2.5)
```
</center>

And if we set the background colour of each area of the plot to the decision the K-nearest neighbour 
classifier would make, we can see that the decision is always "benign," corresponding to the blue colour:

<center>
```{r 05-upsample-2, echo = FALSE, fig.height = 4, fig.width = 5}

#train a knn classifier
features <- rare_cancer %>% select(Perimeter, Concavity)
labels <- rare_cancer %>% select(Class) %>% unlist()
k <- data.frame(k = 7)
model_knn <- train(x = data.frame(features), y = labels, method='knn', tuneGrid = k)

#create a prediction pt grid
per_grid <- seq(min(rare_cancer$Perimeter), max(rare_cancer$Perimeter), length.out = 100)
con_grid <- seq(min(rare_cancer$Concavity), max(rare_cancer$Concavity), length.out = 100)
pcgrid <- expand.grid(Perimeter=per_grid, Concavity=con_grid)
knnPredGrid <- predict(model_knn, newdata=pcgrid)
prediction_table <- bind_cols(pcgrid, data.frame(Class=knnPredGrid))

#create the basic plt
rare_plot <- 
  ggplot() + 
    geom_point(data = prediction_table, mapping=aes(x = Perimeter, y = Concavity, color = Class), alpha=0.02, size=5.)+
    geom_point(data = rare_cancer, mapping=aes(x = Perimeter, y = Concavity, color = Class), alpha=0.75) +
    labs(color = "Diagnosis") + 
    scale_color_manual(labels = c("Benign", "Malignant"), values = cbPalette)

rare_plot
```
</center>

Despite the simplicity of the problem, solving it in a statistically sound manner is actually
fairly nuanced, and a careful treatment would require a lot more detail and mathematics than we will cover in this textbook.
For the present purposes, it will suffice to rebalance the data by *oversampling* the rare class.
In other words, we will replicate rare observations multiple times in our data set to give them more
voting power in the K-nearest neighbour algorithm. In order to do this, we will use the
`upSample` function from the `caret` library. We show below how to do this, and also
use the `group_by + summarize` pattern we've seen before to see that our classes are now balanced:

```{r 05-upsample-cancer}
rare_cancer <- upSample(x = select(rare_cancer, Perimeter, Concavity),
			y = select(rare_cancer, Class) %>% unlist()
			)
rare_cancer %>% 
	group_by(Class) %>%
	summarize(n = n())
```
Now suppose we train our K-nearest neighbour classifier with $K=7$ on this *balanced* data. Setting the background colour 
of each area of our scatter plot to the decision the K-nearest neighbour 
classifier would make, we can see that the decision is more reasonable; when the points are close
to those labelled malignant, the classifier predicts a malignant tumour, and vice versa when they are closer to the benign tumour observations:
<center>
```{r 05-upsample-plot, echo = FALSE, fig.height = 4, fig.width = 5}

#train a knn classifier
features <- rare_cancer %>% select(Perimeter, Concavity)
labels <- rare_cancer %>% select(Class) %>% unlist()
k <- data.frame(k = 7)
model_knn <- train(x = data.frame(features), y = labels, method='knn', tuneGrid = k)

#create a prediction pt grid
per_grid <- seq(min(rare_cancer$Perimeter), max(rare_cancer$Perimeter), length.out = 100)
con_grid <- seq(min(rare_cancer$Concavity), max(rare_cancer$Concavity), length.out = 100)
pcgrid <- expand.grid(Perimeter=per_grid, Concavity=con_grid)
knnPredGrid <- predict(model_knn, newdata=pcgrid)
prediction_table <- bind_cols(pcgrid, data.frame(Class=knnPredGrid))

#create the basic plt
rare_plot <- 
  ggplot() + 
    geom_point(data = prediction_table, mapping=aes(x = Perimeter, y = Concavity, color = Class), alpha=0.02, size=5.)+
    geom_point(data = rare_cancer, mapping=aes(x = Perimeter, y = Concavity, color = Class), alpha=0.75) +
    labs(color = "Diagnosis") + 
    scale_color_manual(labels = c("Benign", "Malignant"), values = cbPalette)

rare_plot
```
