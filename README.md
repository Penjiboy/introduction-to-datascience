## Setup and Build

First, you need to ensure the following libraries/executables are available on your system (the below is for Ubuntu OS; if you aren't on Ubuntu, just run the below `install.packages(...)` command and it will throw errors telling you what to install for your OS)

`
sudo apt-get pandoc, pandoc-citeproc, libssl-dev, libxml2-dev, libfontconfig1-dev, libcairo2-dev
`

Then before rendering the book, you need to install a collection of R packages:

`
install.packages(c("e1071", "rvest", "tidyverse", "caret", "bookdown", "plotly", "gridExtra", "GGally", "svglite"))
`

Finally, you can render the book with the following R code:

`
bookdown::render_book('index.Rmd', 'bookdown::gitbook')
`

## Style Guide

- For R code block labels, use the format `##-[name with only alphanumeric + hyphens]` where the `##` is the 2-digit chapter number, e.g. `03-test-name` for a label `test-name` in chapter 3

## Repository Organization / Important Files
- The files `index.Rmd` and `##-name.Rmd` are [R-markdown](https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/) chapter contents to be parsed by [Bookdown](https://bookdown.org/)
- `_bookdown.yml` sets the output directory (`docs/`) and default chapter name
- `img/` contains custom images to be used in the text; note this is not all of the images as some are generated by R code when compiling
- `data/` stores datasets processed during compile
- `docs/.nojekyll` tells github's static site builder not to run [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/). This avoids Jekyll deleting the folder `docs/_main_files` (as it starts with an underscore)
